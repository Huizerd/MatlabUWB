# MatlabUWB
This project was created to simulate different state estimators for drones using an UWB system for localization. The main file, `EstimatorSimulation_main.m` contains the simulation. The data for the simulation can come from two sources:
1. The `EstimatorSimulation_DataGenerator.m` script
2. Logs from a Crazyflie, brought into the same data format using the `Log2Data.m` script (I will provide the python script for collecting the logs as well once I have it cleaned up)
